As of September 2020, only Merlin is in use.</p><p>Provet was originally in scope, but is no longer being used by IVC UK. There is still the potential desire to support Provet if Pacman is rolled out to IVC Sweden. This means the Provet code has been left in Pacman, but the Provet connection is not enabled in the UK deployments (and hence is not tested, so potentially has some issues which will need to be fixed before re-enabling this).</p><p>Voyager is a PMS created by the same owners as Merlin. This is not currently in use by Pacman, and has never been integrated. The API should apparently be the same as the Merlin API.</p><h2 id="merlin-voyager" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#merlin-voyager" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Merlin &amp; Voyager</h2><p>Note that only Merlin is currently enabled within Pacman.</p><p>Merlin and Voyager are the PMSs created by MWI. They are pretty similar, however Merlin is cloud hosted, whereas Voyager is installed on prem, with a central server for IVC which uses merge replication to synchronise nightly.</p><h3 id="api" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#api" aria-hidden="true">#</a> API</h3><p>Swagger documentation for the dev API: https://dev-api.vetspace.cloud/documentation/swagger/#/</p><p>Authentication is performed using an API Key, which is exchanged for a temporary access token.
